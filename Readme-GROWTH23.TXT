GROWTH-23: an integrated code for inversion of complete Bouguer gravity anomaly or temporal gravity changes 

by Antonio G. Camacho, Peter Vajda, José Fernández


GROWTH is a software for determination of subsurface anomalous density structures from discrete gravity anomaly values. It works in a context of free 3D geometry of the causative bodies. From only very general assumptions, the code determines, in a nearly automatic approach, general anomalous structures described as aggregation of thousands of small rectangular prisms.


This package includes:


    (a) Fortran source code:   GROWTH.for
        
         
    (b) Executable file:     GROWTH23.exe
 
                  
    (c) Files for an application example, corresponding to a gravity survey in the volcanic Island of Tenerife (Canary Islands).


                  Data files:   Gra.txt , and MAP.BLN  (the second one,only for pictures)
 
                  Output files:    MOD.txt, FIL.txt


   (d) Additional files (*.vfproj, *.h, *.rc, *.ico, etc) for compilation.
